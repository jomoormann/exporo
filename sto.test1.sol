/**
 * @title SignatureBouncer
 * @author PhABC, Shrugs and aflesher
 * @dev SignatureBouncer allows users to submit a signature as a permission to
 * do an action.
 * If the signature is from one of the authorized signer addresses, the
 * signature is valid.
 * Note that SignatureBouncer offers no protection against replay attacks, users
 * must add this themselves!
 *
 * Signer addresses can be individual servers signing grants or different
 * users within a decentralized club that have permission to invite other
 * members. This technique is useful for whitelists and airdrops; instead of
 * putting all valid addresses on-chain, simply sign a grant of the form
 * keccak256(abi.encodePacked(`:contractAddress` + `:granteeAddress`)) using a
 * valid signer address.
 * Then restrict access to your crowdsale/whitelist/airdrop using the
 * `onlyValidSignature` modifier (or implement your own using _isValidSignature).
 * In addition to `onlyValidSignature`, `onlyValidSignatureAndMethod` and
 * `onlyValidSignatureAndData` can be used to restrict access to only a given
 * method or a given method with given parameters respectively.
 * See the tests in SignatureBouncer.test.js for specific usage examples.
 *
 * @notice A method that uses the `onlyValidSignatureAndData` modifier must make
 * the _signature parameter the "last" parameter. You cannot sign a message that
 * has its own signature in it so the last 128 bytes of msg.data (which
 * represents the length of the _signature data and the _signaature data itself)
 * is ignored when validating. Also non fixed sized parameters make constructing
 * the data in the signature much more complex.
 * See https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/50616 for more details.
